      <h1>Similarly, the anxiety transmission relation may also stem - paradoxically - 
        from a core <a href="redhover.html" class="rumors">social</a> motive to trust others: to view them as "basically benign"m (Fiske, 2004)
        . Most of the <a href="yellowhover.html" class="back">time</a> we do not trust others, but sometimes it is maladaptive
        to do so, as when they are not interested in our welfare. Individuals are, on average,
        very poor at detecting deception (DePaulo Stone, & Lassiter, 1985). Rumors may be 
        an important - and understudied - group deception detection mechanism; they 
        serve to alert unsuspecting group members about persons and actions
        that should not be trusted. A recent longitudinal study (DiFonzo, Bordia, & Winterkorn, 2003)
        that we conducted in an organization undergoing radical downsizing is consistent with this idea: individuals
        who did not trust the company transmitted negative rumors more than those hwo did, regardless of anxiety.
