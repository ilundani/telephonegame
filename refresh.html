      <h1>While teaching my social psychology class recently, I asked students to  use social influence tactics  in designing  a campaign to persuade 
        people to obtain a free flu shot. “Incidentally,” I asked, “How many of
        you have not received your free flu vaccination?” To my surprise, almost 
         everyone raised their hand. “Why not?” I inquired. “I’ve heard stories of bad side-effects for young people,” Peter in the front row responded. 
         “Really,” I said (I was surprised because I had not heard these tales;
         my physician later told me that there are no such bad side-effects for
         youth). “How many of you have heard stories like this? ”Again, almost all
         raised  their hands.  I pursued  further: “And  how many of you don’t get 
         your
        flu shot because of this?” A third time, almost all raised their hands.
         <br>
         <br>“Hmm,” I mused aloud; "<a href="redhover.html" class="rumors">Rumors</a>influence.”</h1>
