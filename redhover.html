      <h1>Classic rumor differs from gossip and urban legend, 
        though these differences often blur. Gossip is evaluative idle talk about 
        individuals – usually not present –often shared for amusement, to communicate 
        <a href="greenhover.html" class="rumors">social</a> mores, and to exclude some-one from a social group (Gluckman, 1963; 
        Rosnow & Fine, 1976; Smith, Lucas, &Latkin, 1999). An example of gossip:
         “Did you hear that Sally is having an affair?”When we object “That’s gossip!” 
         we are saying that it slanders and it is idle talk;when we object “That’s rumor!”
          we mean that it is unverified (Sabini & Silver,1982). <a href="refresh.html" class="back">Rumor</a> is a morsel of 
          food in an information famine; gossip is a tasty juicytreat at a cocktail party.</h1>
